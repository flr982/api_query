# api_query
First project:
Using an existing publicly available REST API on the internet of your choice (for example Github) and show how you would authenticate (if necessary) against this API and then utilise a part of the API to fetch some information and format it appropriately for storage in data store of your choice.
 
You can go into as much or as little depth as you think is appropriate but it would be good to see some code or command line examples using languages and tools of your choice and also for you to be able to explain and defend your solution.
